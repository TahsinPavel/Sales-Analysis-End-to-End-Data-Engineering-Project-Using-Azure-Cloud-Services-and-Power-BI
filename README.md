# Sales-Analysis-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project-Using-Azure-Cloud-Services-and-Power-BI

In this project, I have developed a robust data architecture using Azure services. Specifically, I utilized Azure Data Lake Gen2 for storage, Azure Data Factory for pipeline creation to facilitate data movement and transformation, and Azure Synapse Analytics for efficient data warehousing and analytics. The data cleaning and transformation process is handled seamlessly with Azure Databricks, leveraging the power of Spark. To visualize the analysis, Microsoft Power BI is employed, creating interactive and up-to-date dashboards. The automation implemented ensures that with the upload of new data to the data warehouse, the entire process is triggered automatically, resulting in the latest reports being updated in Power BI. This real-time updating mechanism ensures that decision-makers have access to the most current insights. Overall, this architecture is well-integrated, scalable, and designed to handle end-to-end data processing and analytics workflows efficiently, embracing modern cloud-based solutions for enhanced scalability and flexibility.
